<h1 id="BIO357">BIO44, Teaching Assistants</h1>

<p> BIO 144 -- Data Analysis in Biology is a 4th semester mandatory course for the approx. 320 biology and biomedicine students. This is a great opportunity to impart to students the wonderful world of quantitative problem solving, in a large, interactive, and enjoyable class.</p>

<p> The course will run every Thursday (for half the class) and Friday (for the other half), for 12 weeks (semester is 14 weeks, but two weeks involve holidays) in the spring semester 2017, from late February to early June. Each afternoon, from 1-5pm, will consist of about 2 hours of lecture (by. Dr Stefanie Muff) and then 2 hours of practical by Prof. Owen Petchey. TAs should be present for the whole 4 hour period. We will cover getting data, managing data, visualising data, summarising data, statistical analysis (mostly linear models, but also some other methods), and communicating results.</p>

<p> TAs should have some experience of helping students, and a good knowledge of data analysis, statistical methods, and R.</p>

<p> Briefing sessions before the course, will introduce TAs to the material.</p>

<p> The final exam will be in early June, and grading shortly thereafter, which TAs will be invited to help with.</p>

<p> Teaching hours will count towards PhD programme requirements: One afternoon will count 5 hours (four hours in class, one hour preparation). Final exam grading hours will also be eligible.</p>

<p> For continuity, any single TA must work on at least seven afternoons, ideally a TA would work on both Thursday and Friday of any single week.</p>

<p> Please sign up for afternoons <a href="https://urpp-gcb.doodle.com/poll/yfkc2mce6uvmvraz">here</a>. You will be asked there for your email address and telephone (mobile please) number. You will be called only in urgent situations, for example if you don’t arrive at a class you signed up for. TAs will get Owen’s number, in case he doesn’t turn up for class (just joking... hopefully).  </p>
